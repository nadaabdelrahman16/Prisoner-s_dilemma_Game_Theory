# Game-Theory
Consider a simultaneous game between two players. Player 1 has n actions (i.e., n pure
strategies), while player 2 has m actions. Thus the payoff matrix representing the game will be of
size n x m , where n and m are any arbitrary positive numbers. Write a code implementation
that takes any arbitrary n x m payoff matrix as an input and does the following:

A) Apply iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies and print out the resulting
payoff matrix, or the solution of the game.

B) Apply iterative elimination of weakly dominated strategies and print out the resulting
payoff matrix, or the solution of the game.

C) Determine the pure Nash equilibria of the game.

D) Determine the pure strict Nash equilibria of the game.

E) Determine the expected payoff for each player when player 1 uses a mixed strategy x and
player 2 uses a mixed strategy y.

F) Determine the trembling hand perfect equilibria of the game.

G) Apply positive affine transformation to the payoff matrix.

H) Assume that the input payoff matrix represents a 2 x 2 symmetric game, find which
category does the game belongs to.

In the report documentation, for each of the previous points (from A to H), you are requested to:

1- Explain the logic flow and steps of your program (you may use a flow chart).

2- Use at least two numerical examples to illustrate the output of your program (provide
snapshots of your program input and output).
